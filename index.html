                    <b>What defines your personality</b>
                    <br/>
                    Intuitive, as someone once said, but I like to say I listen to reason for the benefit of others as well.
                    <br/>
                    <b>What are your favorite foods</b>
                    <br/>
                    I am a part of the weird breed of vegetarians who don’t eat meat or dairy/poultry, but love and can’t give up seafood. At the top of my list of foods are sushi; however, on a daily basis, I love eating all things fruit and veggies, plantain, cassava, and experimenting with new soups.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Do you have any talents</b>
                    <br/>
                    I don’t know if I would consider this a talent, but I love writing. Aside from that I would say I’m pretty good at exercising or doing anything outdoors as a hobby, cooking, and although I don’t practice it anymore, I do like to sing.

                 <p>
                    I typically listen to Jazz, Blues, Rap, Soul, and Afropop/traditional, but I also really enjoy most genres of Rock, RnB, Rap and Hip-Hop. I didn’t get into Jazz until my teen years when the adults around me would play different tunes or point out many modern pop music influenced by Jazz, Blues, Rap, etc. From there, I began to branch out and learn how different genres evolve, how they relate, and the ways in which they are both influenced by and influencers of culture.
